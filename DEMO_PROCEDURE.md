# 🚗 Vehicle App Template - Complete Demo Procedure
## **Step-by-Step Manual Testing Guide**

---

## 🎯 **Demo Overview**

**Objective**: Demonstrate the unified C++ vehicle app template receiving and processing real vehicle signals  
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes  
**Audience**: Technical stakeholders, web platform developers  
**Key Message**: Single-file C++ template delivers production-grade vehicle signal processing with web GUI simplicity

---

## 🛠️ **Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Environment Verification**
```bash
# Verify Docker is running
docker --version
# Expected: Docker version 20.10+ 

# Check available space
df -h
# Need: ~3GB free space for images

# Verify network access
ping -c 1 github.com
# Expected: Successful ping response
```

### **Step 2: Clone and Navigate**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tri2510/vehicle-app-cpp-template.git
cd vehicle-app-cpp-template

# Verify unified template file
ls -la app/src/VehicleApp.cpp
# Expected: Single file ~281 lines (vs traditional 3+ files)
```

### **Step 3: Show Template Structure (Demo Prep)**
```bash
# Highlight template areas for audience
grep -n "🔧 TEMPLATE AREA" app/src/VehicleApp.cpp
# Expected output:
# 102:    // 🔧 TEMPLATE AREA: SIGNAL SUBSCRIPTION
# 139:    // 🔧 TEMPLATE AREA: SIGNAL PROCESSING  
# 222:    // 🔧 TEMPLATE AREA: INITIALIZATION
```

## 🎭 **Main Demo Sequence (10 minutes)**

### **DEMO PART 1: Show Template Simplicity (2 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"Traditional C++ vehicle apps require multiple files and complex setup. Our unified template puts everything in one file with clear modification areas."*

```bash
# Show traditional complexity (if you have comparison)
echo "Traditional approach needs:"
echo "❌ VehicleAppTemplate.h (header file)"  
echo "❌ VehicleAppTemplate.cpp (implementation)"
echo "❌ Launcher.cpp (main function)"
echo "❌ Complex CMakeLists.txt configuration"
echo ""
echo "Our unified approach needs:"
echo "✅ VehicleApp.cpp (everything in one file)"
echo "✅ Simple template areas marked with 🔧"

# Show template areas
head -30 app/src/VehicleApp.cpp | grep -A 5 -B 5 "🔧"
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- 🎯 **Single file** vs multiple files
- 🔧 **Clear template areas** for web GUI modification  
- 📝 **Comprehensive documentation** embedded in code
- 🚀 **Production-ready** from the start

---

### **DEMO PART 2: Build the Application (3 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"Let's build our unified template. The entire Velocitas SDK with vehicle signal processing compiles from this single file."*

```bash
# STEP 1: Build development environment
echo "🔨 Building complete C++ development environment..."
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t velocitas-dev .

# While building, explain what's happening:
echo "This includes:"
echo "- Complete C++ toolchain (GCC, CMake, Ninja)"
echo "- Velocitas SDK v0.7.0"
echo "- Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) 4.0"
echo "- KUKSA.val Vehicle Data Broker"
echo "- All dependencies managed with Conan"
```

```bash
# STEP 2: Compile the unified template
echo "🏗️ Compiling our single-file vehicle application..."
docker run --rm --privileged -v $(pwd):/workspace --network=host velocitas-dev \
  /bin/bash -c "sudo chown -R vscode:vscode /workspace && gen-model && install-deps && build-app"

# STEP 3: Verify executable created
ls -la build-linux-x86_64/Debug/bin/app
echo "✅ Success! 53MB native executable created from single C++ file"
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- ⚡ **Fast compilation** (~30 seconds after deps)
- 🏗️ **Complete build system** working
- 📦 **Self-contained executable** with all dependencies
- 🔧 **Template ready** for modification

---

### **DEMO PART 3: Start Vehicle Services (2 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"Now let's start the vehicle infrastructure - the MQTT broker and Vehicle Data Broker that simulate a real vehicle environment."*

```bash
# Start vehicle services
echo "🚗 Starting vehicle infrastructure..."
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) docker/compose:1.29.2 \
  -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d mosquitto vehicledatabroker

# Verify services running
echo "📊 Vehicle services status:"
docker ps --filter "name=velocitas-"
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        PORTS                    NAMES
abc123def456   ghcr.io/eclipse/kuksa.val/databroker:0.4.3   0.0.0.0:55555->55555/tcp velocitas-vdb
def456abc123   eclipse-mosquitto:2.0                        0.0.0.0:1883->1883/tcp   velocitas-mosquitto
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- 🔌 **Vehicle Data Broker** (port 55555) - VSS signal management
- 📡 **MQTT Broker** (port 1883) - vehicle communication
- 🌐 **Real protocols** used in production vehicles
- ✅ **Infrastructure ready** for signal testing

### **DEMO PART 4: Live Signal Processing Demo (3 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"This is the exciting part - let's run our vehicle app and send real vehicle signals to see the template processing them in real-time!"*

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the vehicle application
echo "🚀 Starting our unified vehicle app template..."
docker run --rm --privileged -v $(pwd):/workspace --network=host velocitas-dev run-app
```

#### **Expected App Output:**
```
🚀 Starting Vehicle App Template...
Using Kuksa Databroker sdv.databroker.v1 API
Connecting to data broker service 'vehicledatabroker' via '127.0.0.1:55555'
🚗 Vehicle App Template starting...
🔧 Vehicle App Template ready - setting up signal subscriptions
✅ Signal subscription completed
App is running.
📡 Waiting for signal data...
```

**🗣️ Pause here and explain:** *"The app is now connected to the Vehicle Data Broker and waiting for signals. Let's send some!"*

```bash
# Terminal 2: Send vehicle signals (open new terminal)
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 15 m/s (city driving)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 15.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 15.00 m/s (54.0 km/h)
🛣️  High speed: highway driving
```

```bash
# Send high speed signal
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 30 m/s (highway - should trigger warning)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 30.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 30.00 m/s (108.0 km/h)
⚠️  High speed detected: 30.00 m/s
🛣️  High speed: highway driving
```

```bash
# Send stopped signal
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 0 m/s (vehicle stopped)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 0.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 0.00 m/s (0.0 km/h)
🛑 Vehicle stopped
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- ⚡ **Real-time processing** (~1 second latency)
- 🧮 **Unit conversion** (m/s to km/h) working perfectly
- 🚨 **Warning system** triggered at high speeds (>25 m/s)
- 🏷️ **Speed categorization** (stopped/medium/high) working
- 📡 **End-to-end signal flow** demonstrated
