## ‚úÖ **Successfully Fixed Root Causes**

### **1. Environment Variable Handling - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** CLI script was overriding `SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS` environment variable  
**Root Cause:** Runtime check function was setting databroker address to "disabled" when localhost wasn't available  
**Fix Applied:** Modified `check_runtime_services()` function in `scripts/velocitas-cli.sh` to respect existing environment variables  

**Code Fix:**
```bash
# Before: Always checked localhost and overrode env vars
if ! nc -z 127.0.0.1 55555 2>/dev/null; then
    export SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS="disabled"
fi

# After: Only check localhost if env var not already configured  
if [ -z "$SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS" ] || [ "$SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS" = "127.0.0.1:55555" ]; then
    # Only then check localhost and set if needed
fi
```

### **2. Network Configuration - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** Vehicle app couldn't reach KUKSA databroker due to Docker network isolation  
**Root Cause:** Vehicle app in `velocitas-test` network trying to reach `127.0.0.1:55555` on host network  
**Fix Applied:** Use `--network host` for both containers to enable localhost communication  

**Working Configuration:**
```bash
# KUKSA Databroker on host network
docker run -d --name kuksa-databroker --network host ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker:main

# Vehicle App on host network with correct env var
docker run -d --network host --name vehicle-app-success \
  -e SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:55555 \
  -e HTTP_PROXY= -e HTTPS_PROXY= -e http_proxy= -e https_proxy= \
  -v $(pwd)/templates/app/src/VehicleApp.cpp:/app.cpp \
  velocitas-quick run 300
```

### **3. Proxy Configuration - FIXED ‚úÖ**
**Problem:** Proxy settings interfering with internal container communication  
**Root Cause:** Container had both uppercase and lowercase proxy env vars set  
**Fix Applied:** Clear all proxy variables for internal communication

## üéâ **Current Working Status**

### **‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING:**

#### **1. Enhanced Build System**
- ‚úÖ File mounting as primary input method
- ‚úÖ Unified CLI with verbose logging  
- ‚úÖ Environment variable handling fixed
- ‚úÖ Runtime environment detection working
- ‚úÖ Build control flags (--verbose, --clean, etc.)

#### **2. Multi-Container Setup**
- ‚úÖ KUKSA databroker running and accessible
- ‚úÖ Vehicle app connecting to correct databroker address
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity established

#### **3. Signal Injection**
- ‚úÖ KUKSA client can connect to databroker
- ‚úÖ Signal injection working (`setValue Vehicle.Speed 55.0, 60.0, 65.0, 70.0`)
- ‚úÖ Values stored in databroker (confirmed via `getValue`)

#### **4. Vehicle App Connection**
- ‚úÖ Runtime detection: `Vehicle Data Broker available (127.0.0.1:55555)`
- ‚úÖ App logs: `Connecting to data broker service 'vehicledatabroker' via '127.0.0.1:55555'`
- ‚úÖ Subscription setup: `Signal subscription completed - waiting for vehicle data...`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining Issue: Signal Subscription**

### **Current Status**
The vehicle app establishes connection but subscription fails:
```
‚ùå Signal subscription error: RPC 'Subscribe' failed:
```

### **Analysis**
- **Connection**: ‚úÖ Working (app connects to databroker)
- **Signal Storage**: ‚úÖ Working (KUKSA client can set/get values)
- **Subscription**: ‚ùå Failing (vehicle app not receiving signal updates)

### **Likely Causes**
1. **Subscription timing**: App may need to establish subscription before signals are injected
2. **VSS signal compatibility**: Vehicle app using different VSS spec than databroker
3. **gRPC subscription protocol**: Velocitas SDK may use different subscription method than KUKSA client

## üìä **Test Results Summary**

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Build System** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Enhanced CLI, file mounting, env vars |
| **Network Setup** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Host network, localhost connectivity |
| **KUKSA Databroker** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Running, accessible, storing signals |
| **Signal Injection** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | KUKSA client successfully sets values |
| **Vehicle App Connection** | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | Connects to databroker via 127.0.0.1:55555 |
| **Signal Subscription** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** | Connection works, subscription fails |
| **End-to-End Signal Flow** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **PENDING** | Awaiting subscription fix |

## üß™ **Validated Test Scenarios**

### **Manual Signal Injection Test**
```bash
# 1. Start KUKSA databroker
docker run -d --name kuksa-databroker --network host ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker:main

# 2. Start vehicle app  
docker run -d --network host --name vehicle-app-success \
  -e SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:55555 \
  -e HTTP_PROXY= -e HTTPS_PROXY= -e http_proxy= -e https_proxy= \
  -v $(pwd)/templates/app/src/VehicleApp.cpp:/app.cpp \
  velocitas-quick run 300

# 3. Inject signals
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 55.0" | docker run --rm -i --network host \
  -e HTTP_PROXY= -e HTTPS_PROXY= -e http_proxy= -e https_proxy= \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main grpc://127.0.0.1:55555

# 4. Verify signal storage
echo "getValue Vehicle.Speed" | docker run --rm -i --network host \
  -e HTTP_PROXY= -e HTTPS_PROXY= -e http_proxy= -e https_proxy= \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main grpc://127.0.0.1:55555
```

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ Databroker starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Vehicle app connects to databroker
- ‚úÖ Signal injection returns "OK"
- ‚úÖ Signal storage confirmed (value: 55.0, timestamp: 2025-06-24T09:20:33)
- ‚ùå Vehicle app doesn't receive signal updates

## üîß **Key Technical Fixes Applied**

### **1. CLI Script Enhancement (`scripts/velocitas-cli.sh`)**
- Modified `check_runtime_services()` to respect existing environment variables
- Added proper proxy handling logic
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### **2. Docker Network Configuration**
- Changed from custom Docker network to host network
- Enables localhost communication between containers
- Resolves network isolation issues

### **3. Environment Variable Management**
- Clear all proxy variables for internal communication
- Proper SDV_VEHICLEDATABROKER_ADDRESS handling
- Runtime environment detection improvements

---

## üéØ **Next Steps for Complete Fix**

### **Immediate Actions Needed:**
1. **Investigate subscription protocol** - Compare Velocitas SDK subscription vs KUKSA client
2. **Check VSS compatibility** - Ensure vehicle app and databroker use same VSS spec
3. **Debug subscription timing** - Try establishing subscription before signal injection
4. **Test alternative signals** - Try different VSS signals beyond Vehicle.Speed

### **Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Direct query mode** - Modify vehicle app to poll signals instead of subscribe
2. **Subscription retry logic** - Add retry mechanism for failed subscriptions
3. **VSS spec alignment** - Ensure both components use identical VSS specification
