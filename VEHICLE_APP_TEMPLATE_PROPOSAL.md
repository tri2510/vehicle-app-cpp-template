echo "Traditional approach needs:"
echo "❌ VehicleAppTemplate.h (header file)"  
echo "❌ VehicleAppTemplate.cpp (implementation)"
echo "❌ Launcher.cpp (main function)"
echo "❌ Complex CMakeLists.txt configuration"
echo ""
echo "Our unified approach needs:"
echo "✅ VehicleApp.cpp (everything in one file)"
echo "✅ Simple template areas marked with 🔧"
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- 🎯 **Single file** vs multiple files
- 🔧 **Clear template areas** for web GUI modification  
- 📝 **Comprehensive documentation** embedded in code

```bash
# STEP 1: Build development environment
echo "🔨 Building complete C++ development environment..."
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t velocitas-dev .
```

**While building, explain:**
- Complete C++ toolchain (GCC, CMake, Ninja)
- Velocitas SDK v0.7.0
- Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) 4.0
- KUKSA.val Vehicle Data Broker
- All dependencies managed with Conan

```bash
# STEP 2: Compile the unified template
echo "🏗️ Compiling our single-file vehicle application..."
docker run --rm --privileged -v $(pwd):/workspace --network=host velocitas-dev \
  /bin/bash -c "sudo chown -R vscode:vscode /workspace && gen-model && install-deps && build-app"

# STEP 3: Verify executable created
ls -la build-linux-x86_64/Debug/bin/app
echo "✅ Success! 53MB native executable created from single C++ file"
```

#### **Key Points:**
- ⚡ **Fast compilation** (~30 seconds after deps)
- 🏗️ **Complete build system** working
- 📦 **Self-contained executable** with all dependencies

---

### **DEMO PART 3: Start Vehicle Services (2 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"Now let's start the vehicle infrastructure - the MQTT broker and Vehicle Data Broker that simulate a real vehicle environment."*

```bash
# Start vehicle services
echo "🚗 Starting vehicle infrastructure..."
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) docker/compose:1.29.2 \
  -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d mosquitto vehicledatabroker

# Verify services running
echo "📊 Vehicle services status:"
docker ps --filter "name=velocitas-"
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                        PORTS                    NAMES
abc123def456   ghcr.io/eclipse/kuksa.val/databroker:0.4.3   0.0.0.0:55555->55555/tcp velocitas-vdb
def456abc123   eclipse-mosquitto:2.0                        0.0.0.0:1883->1883/tcp   velocitas-mosquitto
```

#### **Key Points:**

### **DEMO PART 4: Live Signal Processing Demo (3 minutes)**

#### **Talk Track:**
*"This is the exciting part - let's run our vehicle app and send real vehicle signals to see the template processing them in real-time!"*

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the vehicle application
echo "🚀 Starting our unified vehicle app template..."
docker run --rm --privileged -v $(pwd):/workspace --network=host velocitas-dev run-app
```

#### **Expected App Output:**
```
🚀 Starting Vehicle App Template...
Using Kuksa Databroker sdv.databroker.v1 API
Connecting to data broker service 'vehicledatabroker' via '127.0.0.1:55555'
🚗 Vehicle App Template starting...
🔧 Vehicle App Template ready - setting up signal subscriptions
✅ Signal subscription completed
App is running.
📡 Waiting for signal data...
```

**🗣️ Pause and explain:** *"The app is now connected to the Vehicle Data Broker and waiting for signals. Let's send some!"*

```bash
# Terminal 2: Send vehicle signals (open new terminal)
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 15 m/s (city driving)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 15.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 15.00 m/s (54.0 km/h)
🛣️  High speed: highway driving
```

```bash
# Send high speed signal
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 30 m/s (highway - should trigger warning)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 30.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 30.00 m/s (108.0 km/h)
⚠️  High speed detected: 30.00 m/s
🛣️  High speed: highway driving
```

```bash
# Send stopped signal
echo "📤 Sending vehicle speed: 0 m/s (vehicle stopped)"
echo "setValue Vehicle.Speed 0.0" | docker run -i --rm --network host \
  ghcr.io/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-python-sdk/kuksa-client:main "grpc://localhost:55555"
```

#### **Expected App Response:**
```
📊 Received signal: Vehicle.Speed = 0.00 m/s (0.0 km/h)
🛑 Vehicle stopped
```

#### **Key Points to Highlight:**
- ⚡ **Real-time processing** (~1 second latency)
- 🧮 **Unit conversion** (m/s to km/h) working perfectly
- 🚨 **Warning system** triggered at high speeds (>25 m/s)
- 🏷️ **Speed categorization** (stopped/medium/high) working
- 📡 **End-to-end signal flow** demonstrated
